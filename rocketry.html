                        <p>The days leading up to the launch required intensive preparation and problem-solving:</p>
                        <p>When the team discovered the engine didn't fit into the rocket the night before launch, they worked through the night to modify the mounting system. Additionally, at the launch site, the team had to add weight to the rocket to ensure it would pass safety checks and not exceed the target altitude.</p>
                        <p>Safety was a primary concern throughout the process. The team needed to coordinate COVID-19 protocols to ensure all participants could safely attend the launch and return to campus or travel home afterward. For two team members who were graduating the next day, this timing was particularly critical.</p>

                        <p>The team successfully launched the rocket twice on May 16, 2021, using both the Aerotech L875 and the more powerful Aerotech M1350 engines. The rocket performed as designed, reaching the target altitude of 10,000 feet.</p>
                        <p>This achievement was particularly significant given that the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) had been canceled for the year due to the pandemic. Despite this setback, the team persevered and achieved their goal outside of the competition framework.</p>
