                    <div class="implementation-content">
                        <p>Phoenix III represented Olin Rocketry's first 10,000ft class rocket, designed to deliver a 4kg payload to 10,000 feet and recover successfully. The project faced unprecedented challenges when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, forcing the team to adapt to remote collaboration while maintaining the ambitious technical goals.</p>
                        <p>The team had to overcome significant obstacles including the cancellation of the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC), remote collaboration between team members studying from different locations, and the need to coordinate with first-year students who had no previous rocketry experience. Additionally, the project required L3 certification oversight and complex logistical coordination to transport team members and equipment to the Vermont launch site while maintaining COVID-19 safety protocols.</p>

                    <div class="implementation-content">
                        <p>The team developed an innovative hybrid collaboration model that connected remote and on-campus team members through Zoom meetings, enabling effective knowledge transfer and project coordination. Working with experienced mentors and L3-certified oversight, the team maintained high technical standards while adapting to pandemic constraints.</p>
                        <p>The rocket assembly process was carefully designed around the 24-hour glue drying time required for structural integrity. The team built the rocket outdoors under the Olin oval tent, implementing a modular assembly approach that accommodated the curing process while ensuring all components met safety and performance requirements.</p>
                        <p>To address the challenge of team members with varying experience levels, the team created a comprehensive knowledge transfer system that enabled effective collaboration and skill development across the entire team.</p>

                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <div class="implementation-content">
                        <p>Phoenix III was designed with specific technical specifications to achieve the 10,000ft target altitude. The rocket stood 7 feet tall with a 6-inch diameter, powered by M-class engines (1,151 - 2,302 lbfÂ·s) and featuring a dual event recovery system. The team carefully selected the Aerotech L875 and M1350 engines based on performance calculations to ensure optimal flight characteristics.</p>
                        <p>The launch preparation process required intensive problem-solving and last-minute adjustments. When the team discovered the engine didn't fit into the rocket the night before launch, they worked through the night to modify the mounting system. At the launch site, the team had to add weight to the rocket to ensure it would pass safety checks and not exceed the target altitude, demonstrating the importance of adaptable design and quick problem-solving skills.</p>
                        <p>The team coordinated a livestream system so family members across the world could watch the launch remotely, showcasing the innovative approach to maintaining community engagement during the pandemic. This technical achievement was particularly significant given that IREC had been canceled for the year, yet the team persevered and achieved their goal outside of the competition framework.</p>
