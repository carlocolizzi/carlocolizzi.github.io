                    <div class="implementation-content">
                        <p>Applying to jobs is demanding and repetitive. Candidates must tailor their CVs, write unique cover letters, and answer detailed questionnaires for each position. This cycle drains time and energy, even when applicants are well qualified.</p>
                        <p>Because the work is so repetitive, many applications end up generic. Instead of standing out, they blur together, limiting how many quality opportunities candidates can pursue at once.</p>

                        <p>Apply AI streamlines this process by creating a persistent professional profile. The profile captures skills, achievements, and tone from a user’s CV and a short onboarding questionnaire, forming the foundation for all applications.</p>
                        <p>When users paste a job link, the system parses the posting and generates a tailored cover letter and CV edits. Applications are tracked automatically, giving candidates a clear record of where they applied and how each submission was positioned.</p>

                        <p>The process begins with profile setup. Users upload a CV and complete a guided questionnaire, which captures experiences, career goals, and key skills. This data forms a structured base that the platform reuses across all applications.</p>
                        <p>When a job link is added, Apply AI parses the posting, identifies requirements, and generates tailored materials that highlight relevant experiences. Each application is stored for easy tracking, and a Chrome extension is planned to handle in-site forms and supplemental questions.</p>

                    <div class="implementation-content">
                        <p>Most job seekers rely on either ChatGPT prompts or job-board autofill tools. The first requires re-explaining your background for every role, while the second focuses only on keywords. Both approaches produce shallow or inconsistent results.</p>
                        <p>Apply AI bridges this gap by retaining a persistent understanding of your career story. It learns from past responses, preserves your style, and produces narrative-quality applications that feel authentic rather than templated.</p>
